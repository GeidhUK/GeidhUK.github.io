[Gàidhlig]({{site.baseurl}}/mu-dheidhinn/ "Leugh seo sa Ghàidhlig") | English

My name is Crìstean MacMhìcheil (Chris Mitchell). I'm originally from [Dingwall](http://macmhicheil.uk/inbhir-pheofharain/) in the Scottish Highlands, but I now live in Tain where I work as Assistant Transport Manager, Deputy PFSO and IT Manager for [Bannerman Transport](http://bannerman.ltd.uk/).

I started learning Gàidhlig when I was a pupil at [Dingwall Academy](http://www.dingwallacademy.com/). I enjoyed it greatly and when I left high school in 2005 I studied [CertHE Cùrsa Comais](http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gd/cursaichean/cert-he-an-cursa-comais) at [Inverness College](https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk).

Between 2006 and 2010 I was a student at [Sabhal Mòr Ostaig](http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gd/) on the Isle of Skye studying a [BA (Hons) in Gàidhlig and Development](http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gd/cursaichean/ba-le-urram-gaidhlig-agus-leasachadh).

I have a keen interest in technology and as part of my 1st year at SMO I too a course in computing where created this website as part of the syllabus .

I am gay and when I was at SMO, I was didn't know a lot of other LGBT Gaels so I started GayGaels, a Bebo chatroom, where LGBT Gaels could meet online.

In 2007 I created [AbairThusa](https://web.archive.org/web/20130125063235/http://abairthusa.co.uk/), the first ever Gaelic social network.

In 2008 I started [Gèidh.uk](http://geidh.uk/) under the name of Naidheachdan Pinc to publish LGBT news through the medium of Gàidhlig.

Because of my love of Apple technology, I started [An t-Ubhal-ghort](http://macmhicheil.uk/category/teicneolas/) in order to write about it and I am now learning to write iOS/macOS apps in Swift which I will be releasing under the name of [AtUG Apps](http://macmhicheil.uk/applaidean/).
