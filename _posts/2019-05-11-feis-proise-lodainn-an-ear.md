Our main event, the Pride Saltire Festival, takes place in the gorgeous East Lothian venue of Cockenzie House and Gardens. The Pride Saltire Grand Launch in February 2018 attracted over 400 visitors, who enjoyed a mixture of live music, arts and crafts, debate and dancing, plus a community fair.

Keen to build on this success, our ideas for the 2019 Pride Saltire Festival are even more ambitious. As the theme for this year is “Grass Root Talent”, we want to encourage as many people as possible from the East Lothian LGBTI and our Ally Communities to join us, participate, and to showcase their skills.

Our plans are still very much in development, but here are some of the things that will be happening on the day:

Live Music
Community Fair
LGBT Youth Area
Live Broadcast by Scene Radio
Pride Saltire Dog Show

The Pride Saltire Festival will remain a FREE event. Anyone can attend, and we are super dog-friendly!
