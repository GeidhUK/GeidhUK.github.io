We are delighted to announce a summer date on Sunday 21 July for this year’s Proud Ness in Inverness! This will be the second free large scale LGBTQ+ event for the Highlands with a parade through Inverness city centre (start location will be confirmed shortly) to Bught Park where there will be information on offer from different organisations which serve the LGBTQ+ community, speakers, and music from Inverness Gigs under a large marquee. There will also be a funfair, inflatable city for children, and food and drink stalls.

We really hope that we can top the number of people coming along which was estimated at nearly 6000 attendees! Please bring along your friends, your work colleagues, your granny…there really will be something for everyone on the day!

Proud Ness, will be one of the top featured attractions at this year’s Inverness Gala Day. The Proud Ness party, following the march, will be located in and around, the Gathering Tent. The day will also feature Ruff Ness dog event, Well Ness show, and Exclusively Highlands Craft Fair and Traders Village.
Inverness Gala is organised by the Highland Council Events team who have been working closely with us to provide a large outdoor space to accommodate and entertain you lovely people and ensure that Proud Ness 2019 is BIGGER and BETTER!
