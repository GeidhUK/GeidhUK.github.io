Perthshire Pride aims to give a voice to the LGBT+ community in Perthshire. The community has always been here, as in any other area, however it has had very little coverage or celebration. We as a charity do not just want to tell everyone in Perthshire that this community exists, but also allow the people who are part of it, that it is ok to celebrate who you are! As someone who identifies as LGBT+ it is important to me that others feel they can express themselves. Through education and support we can help people understand and at the same time allow for people within this community to feel safe. We are always learning new ways to support people, it is through meet-ups and events that we can discuss the best way to enjoy being in Perthshire as LGBT+.
