Celebrate diversity at Elgin Library this February with a wide range of resources for LGBT History Month.

Throughout the whole month, pop in and learn about LGBT authors, borrow some diverse titles, check out our reading lists and displays, and collect information about LGBT issues.

Keep an eye on our Facebook page for recommended #rainbowreads as well. February is bright at Elgin Library!
