The Traverse Theatre hosts the Pride Plays, Scotland's first ever LGBTQI+ playwright festival - three evenings of originally written plays by LGBTQI+ writers, as part of LGBT History Month Scotland 2019.

<!--more-->

Pride Plays are giving the stage to voices of a community who currently feel under represented in Scottish theatre.

Each play will be performed as a rehearsed reading, with two plays per night followed by a post-show discussion led by the director and playwright. The playwrights have had development time and support from Laurie Motherwell and LGBTQI+ organisations.

£7 (£5). Tickets for all three nights of Pride Plays available for £15 (£9.99). Book your tickets online [here](https://www.traverse.co.uk/whats-on/event-detail/1704/the-pride-plays.aspx).
